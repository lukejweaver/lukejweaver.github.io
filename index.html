                        <div class="f2">
                            <p>Hey there! Thanks for stopping by. My name is Luke Weaver and I am an undergraduate at Lehigh University where I have the pleasure of studying physics with a bunch of cool people.
                            Before you dive right in and take a look at my little webpage, I have a small preamble to get you caught up with my background!
                            <!-- <p>The common theme that you will notice cropping up throughout my research, education, and life experiences is the incredible people who have s. -->
                            <p>Before starting college, I worked at an insurance technology startup called Benefix as an Associate Software Engineer. While there, I met several incredible people who
                                fostered my curiosity and encouraged me to continue learning.
                            <p>Early in my college career, before I knew what I wanted to study, I met a professor who introduced me to their research and invited me to join their research group. Incidentally,
                                they were a physics professor. Before long, I found myself engrossed in the subject and I realized that I never wanted to stop researching. Naturally,
                                this led to my decision to study physics!
                            <p>An important theme I want to highlight before you move on to the next section - assuming you've read this at all - is that without the wonderful people that I have met throughout my life,
                                I have no idea where I would be or what I would be doing. So, to the many mentors, friends, roommates, and family members who have encouraged and helped guide me, I give the most sincere thank you.

                                I have researched at several institutions, namely <i>Lehigh University</i>, the <i>Singapore University of Technology and Design</i>, and <i>CERN</i>. Consequently, I developed a broad array of
                                skills that are particularly useful in research, including data analysis, physical vapor deposition, optical alignment/laser usage, cryogenics, and hardware-level programming. I intend to continue
                                my research journey, learning as much as I can.
